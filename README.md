# UDP_Server_Client_System
- UDP Protocol is used to broadcast data from a sender to all other connected receiver.
- In this protocol, the sender cannot know whether the data has been received or not by receivers. It just broadcasts the data.
- In this system, there is a server to send data to other client.
- To show it, I set an example. The server sends a message repeatly. The message is "The UDP Protocol sends this message.".
- When a receiver catch the message, it prints the received message to screen.
- The message can be manipulated by other clients. Thus, other clients can change, add or delete something by using the received data.
